            <p>Hi I am Lesedi, I enjoy reading and writing. I spend most of my time studying.
                I choose to study with BUY Pathway as it allows me to be able to work and study at the same time and most
                importantly the degrees offered are international.
                I hope to encourage others to also join in becuase there are a lot of opportunities. I live in South Africa
                and I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. I want to become a software developer.
                I've had experience in sofware development and customer servive.
                My biggest goa; in life is to be self-reliant. Its not easy to break into the tech industry, esecially when
                you have no network, as in the people that you know that there are part of the tech industry and can help
                you in terms of their experiences and connect you with people they know.
                As a young person I feel that its important to be flexible and to not limit yourself to screen time you miss
                miss the important things outside of screen time.
                Besides the fact of showing your talent and skills with developing apps and websites people want to know
                what can of person is behind the screen.
                It important to live a balanced life.
            </p>
